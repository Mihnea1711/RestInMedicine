# Proiect POS

## TODOs (bonus)
### Improve logging 
	- add a wrapper class that has a easy to change/apply format to every log in app instead of manually modify each one)
### Use the context more often 
	- the wait time for the request before it is cancelled could be stored inside the context and initialized at root context creation from config file
